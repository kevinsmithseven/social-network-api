# Social Network API

## Description

An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It contains CRUD routes for creating a user, thought and reaction, getting all users and thoughts, getting a single user or thought by ID, updating users and thoughts, delete routes for users, thoughts and reactions, and routes for adding and removing friends. Additionally, there are friend counts and reaction counts in the data as they are added and removed.

## Usage

In order to use this application, the user will need to clone the code to their local machine, open the terminal, and run the "NPM Install" CLI command. It would be helpful to use a program such as Insomnia to be able to seed data and test the various CRUD routes.

Below is a link to a demonstration video that shows the various routes. If you wish to duplicate this in your own testing environment, the routes are in the URL bar at the top of the video.
